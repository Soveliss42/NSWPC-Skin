# NSWPC-Skin
the odds of me updating this if anything on gamepad viewer changes enough to break it are very low

This is a skin created for Gamepad Viewer that, afaik, only works if used in the custom css in OBS studio. <br/>
It'll probably also work if you know another way to make gamepad viewer actually read the css instead of trying to read it from rawgit... <br/>
That's because Gamepad Viewer assumes it can pull the repo's files from rawgit despite it being nearly 4 years out of service,
and so it dead-ends there on the actual website, unless you're using an old enough skin <br/>
That being said, this here is a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller skin <br/>
All images were made/edited by me, Soveliss. <br/>
The code is based off that of the example custom css provided by the creator of gamepad viewer, and I also referenced the CSS behind
 skins by Million Lights and HawkyYT to help me understand what was going on (thought it ended up being trial and error mostly) <br/>

This works by creating a browser source in OBS, linking it to "https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&s=1" <br/>
and then pasting the contents of the CSS file (Switch-Format.css) into the custom CSS box underneath that <br/>
Voila! <br/>
Here's a screenshot of what it looks like 18 feb 2022: <br/>
